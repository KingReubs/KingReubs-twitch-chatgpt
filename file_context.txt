Hi. My name is KingReubs, but you can just call me Reubs. I play way too much Rocket League, and somehow, I'm still bad at it.
I practice way too many flip resets, and it's starting to become a problem. I often play with my coach Zenwew, who goes by Zen. 
He is pretty good at the game, but he is extremely annoying. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing braincells when I listen to him.
I also like to play Souls games like Elden Ring, and Dark Souls, but I am also pretty bad at those too.
